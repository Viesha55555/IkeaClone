# IkeaClone
MVC project for small Ikea Clone shop

There are two available order records hardcoded in the solution for demo purposes - 1 and 2.

User pointing models are documented with swagger. They can be seen by launching the project with profile "IkeaClone" and going to this url: https://localhost:7146/swagger/index.html (info about profiles and ports are available in ..\IkeaClone\IkeaClone\Properties\launchSettings.json).
